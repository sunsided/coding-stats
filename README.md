# Explorative Analysis of my Codings Stats

A simple explorative analysis of my coding stats. I use WakaTime since late 2016 to track my
use of programming languages and periodically fetch the daily stats from the WakaTime API.
In this repo, I ran some trivial analytics from those JSON files. If for whatever reason you are
curious, the `redacted.csv` contains the language specific information. I excluded the source
data from this repo since it can hypothetically contain mildly sensitive details such as project
and machine names.

I mainly wanted to see how my Rust journey went compared to other languages and at the very least
it's interesting to say that within the last two-ish years as of writing this, I spent as much time
writing Rust code as I spent time writing Python code since the recording started.

The C# curve is pretty linear, which is not surprising since I have been working in .NET focused
companies since 2008 and therefore use C# a lot during my work life. What is interesting however
is that for the last three years I have not actively assumed the role of a software developer
and _still_ maintained a linear progression there.
